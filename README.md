## tempo <-> compile scheduling engine

*... this is where we replace all the cron stuff*

*... because the code we run is in multiple repos, this needs to be a repo*

## documentation

- to be honest, I don't really know how it (the main scripts - scheduler.py, worker.py) works

- I just ran both the files and one threw an error saying it was already working

- I think you can also mess around in the UI or through the CLI and it's easy enough
